# Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group Signature with Elliptic Curve Cryptograhpy.


Minimalistic implementation of a [Verifiable (t, n) threshold signature scheme based on elliptic curve)
](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02828641) with python.

This implementation serves as a proof of concept. DO NOT TRY TO USE THIS FOR ANY REAL USE CASE. THIS HAS NOT BEEN TESTED EXTERNALLY.

Generate a threshold key to encrypt and decrypt messages:

```python


```


### Stuff used to make this:

 * [ECDSA](https://github.com/warner/python-ecdsa) ECDSA cryptography python library.
